# Google Homepage - The Odin Project (project 1)

### This is my first project submission for The Odin Project's "Web Development 101" course. 
#### In this project I used my basic understanding of HTML and CSS to create a static page that looks like the Google homepage. While it looks very rough and is certianly not finished, I learned a lot creating this page and it helped me understand how the HTML and CSS documents "talk" to one another. 

#### I'm sure I'll be back to edit this periodicly as improve my web development skills.
